# StackOverflow Survey Analysis
Stack Overflow conducts yearly surveys from their users. The survey contains questions asking about the participants' salary, happiness in the workplace, competitiveness at the work place, their education, their thoughts about AI, and many more. The 2018 survey results were [published publicly](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey) on Kaggle and I thought I would explore it a little for my first data analysis project.

I thought something that would be interesting to explore would be the differences in responses to questions between men and women. As many know, there is quite a gender gap in the tech world. Maybe there is something that this survey could tell us about that? Maybe it is not so obvious?

For now I've just taken a look at the responses to questions about the importance of certain aspects of a job opportunity. Participants were asked to rate on a scale of 1-10 the importance of things like benefits, industry, company culture, etc. 

There is truly so much to explore with this data set and I hope to do more!
